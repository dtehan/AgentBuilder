# Prompt

## History

This is the history of the conversation. Each entry in the history contains a user prompt and the corresponding agent response. Take this and use it to understand the next user request. This way our fork terminal agent can provide a more accurate and contextually relevant response.

```yaml
- history:
    - user_prompt_summary: <user prompt summary>
      agent_response_summary: <agent response summary> 
    - user_prompt: <user prompt>
      agent_response: <agent response>
    - user_prompt: <user prompt>
      agent_response: <agent response>
    - user_prompt: <user prompt>
```
